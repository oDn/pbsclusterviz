 - the boxes for the nodes sit *in* the plane instead of *on* the plane
 - in non-interactive mode only the text "Initialization" is shown
    - we should be seeing here all current log messages
 - down nodes aren't shown anymore
    - a node which has the state "down" should show up as a grey box/square
      in the grid
 - the pbsnodes.xml file should not be automatically created when the
   -x <xmlfile>  is used

Probably several more.  This is why a test suite is needed...
