 - a reload (by pressing the 'r' key) zooms out and makes the image too
   small
      - This behavior is hard coded into vtk. Pressing R resets the camera to zoom factor = 1.
        As it is impossible to catch the key press for a workaround we might need to make the boxes 30% bigger.
      - This doesn't help at all because the camera's zoom is tenaciously adjusted to the model.

Probably several more.  This is why a test suite is needed...
