 - a reload (by pressing the 'r' key) zooms out and makes the image too
   small
 - UpdateBalloonString() appears first in vtk 5.8, however we need to
   support vtk 5.4+.  This method needs to be replaced with another
   mechanism which does the same thing but doesn't break the minimum
   configuration requirements.

Probably several more.  This is why a test suite is needed...
