For the 0.7 release:
 - update the documentation

For the 0.8 release:
 - add support for building Debian and RPM packages
 - implement a better format for the node file?

For the 0.9 release:
 - add an "update" button
 - add a "toggle job/load view" button

For the future:
 - need to clean up the code a bit and do some more testing
 - 3D visualisation in a browser.  X3D or VRML or what?  Need to investigate
   - X3D is VRML 3.0...  FreeWML is a good visualiser of X3D files and it
     provides a web browser plugin
