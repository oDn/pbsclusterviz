For the 0.8 release:
 - add support for building Debian and RPM packages
 - implement a better format for the node file?
 - start a test suite with unit- and integration-tests
 - is it possible to run pbsclusterviz on Windows?
 - total memory usage for a node in text balloons:
    when a balloon is shown (with 'i') then not only the currently running
    jobs should be shown, but also the currently requested memory as a
    percentage of the total (available) memory should be shown
 - support Python 2.x and Python 3.x

For the 0.9 release:
 - add an "update" button
 - add a "toggle job/load view" button

For the future:
 - need to clean up the code a bit and do some more testing
 - 3D visualisation in a browser.  X3D or VRML or what?  Need to investigate
   - X3D is VRML 3.0...  FreeWML is a good visualiser of X3D files and it
     provides a web browser plugin
