 - implement the configuration file format that Holger recently used for the
   node list
 - need to clean up the code a bit and do some more testing
 - 3D visualisation in a browser.  X3D or VRML or what?  Need to investigate
   - X3D is VRML 3.0...  FreeWML is a good visualiser of X3D files and it
     provides a web browser plugin
 - add support for building Debian and RPM packages
 - nodes which are "offline" should also be noted in the log
 - only "down" nodes should be shown in grey
